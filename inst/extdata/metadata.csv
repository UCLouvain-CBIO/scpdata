Single cell proteomics data acquired by the SlavovLab. This is the version 2 of the data released in December 2019. It contains quantitative information of monocytes (U-937) and macrophages at PSM, peptide and protein level.","3.11",NA,"CSV","https://scope2.slavovlab.net/docs/data",NA,"Homo sapiens",9606,TRUE,"SlavovLab","Christophe Vanderaa <christophe.vanderaa@uclouvain.be>","QFeatures","Rda","scpdata/specht2019v2.Rda",2019-12-05,179,NA

Single-cell proteomics using nanoPOTS combined with TMT isobaric labeling. It contains quantitative information at PSM and protein level. The samples are commercial Hela digest diluted to single cell amounts (0.2ng). The boosting wells contain the same digest but at higher dose (10 ng).","3.11",NA,"XLS/XLSX","https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b03349",NA,"Homo sapiens",9606,TRUE,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Christophe Vanderaa <christophe.vanderaa@uclouvain.be>","QFeatures","Rda","scpdata/dou2019_lysates.Rda",2019-10-15,3,NA
"3","dou2019_mouse","Dou et al. 2019: single cells from cultured murine cell lines.
Single-cell proteomics using nanoPOTS combined with TMT isobaric labeling. It contains quantitative information at PSM and protein level. The cell types are either 'Raw' (macrophage cells), 'C10' (epihelial cells), or 'SVEC' (endothelial cells). Out of the 132 wells, 72 contain single cells, corresponding to 24 C10 cells, 24 RAW cells, and 24 SVEC. The other wells are either boosting channels (12), empty channels (36) or reference channels (12). Boosting and reference channels are balanced (1:1:1) mixes of C10, SVEC, and RAW samples at 5 ng and 0.2 ng, respectively. The different cell types where evenly distributed across 4 nanoPOTS chips. Samples were 11-plexed with TMT labeling.","3.11",NA,"XLS/XLSX","https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b03349",NA,"Mus musculus",10090,TRUE,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Christophe Vanderaa <christophe.vanderaa@uclouvain.be>","QFeatures","Rda","scpdata/dou2019_mouse.Rda",2019-10-15,13,NA
"4","dou2019_boosting","Dou et al. 2019: testing boosting ratios.
Single-cell proteomics using nanoPOTS combined with TMT isobaric labeling. It contains quantitative information at PSM and protein level. The cell types are either 'Raw' (macrophage cells), 'C10' (epihelial cells), or 'SVEC' (endothelial cells). Each cell is replicated 2 or 3x. Each cell type was run using 3 levels of boosting: 0 ng (no boosting), 5 ng or 50 ng. When boosting was applied, 1 reference well and 1 boosting well were added, otherwise 1 empty well was added. Each boosting setting (0ng, 5ng, 50ng) was run in duplicate.","3.11",NA,"XLS/XLSX","https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b03349",NA,"Mus musculus",10090,TRUE,"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Christophe Vanderaa <christophe.vanderaa@uclouvain.be>","QFeatures","Rda","scpdata/dou2019_boosting.Rda",2019-10-15,7,NA
